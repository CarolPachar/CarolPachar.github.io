## Work Experience
Tutor @ Dutchess Community College (February 2023 – December 2024) 
  - Offered tutoring services in Calculus (1-3), Linear Algebra, and Discrete Mathematics
  - Served as a teaching assistant for the mathematics department for classes with over 25 students
 
Research Intern @ Clarkson University (May 2022 – August 2022) 
* Used Python to replicate the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) localization algorithm to determine the location of a specific target sensor node.  
* Developed and implemented the Fitzhugh-Nagumo Model in Python to highlight the advantages of using the TDOA algorithm over other localization algorithms. 
* Presented research findings in the RAPS conference hosted by Clarkson University   

## Projects
[Finding False Prime Numbers](https://github.com/CarolPachar/Finding-False-Primes.git) (September 2025)
* Created a Python program to find all possible non-prime numbers that satisfy Fermat’s Little Theorem, also called Carmichael numbers. These numbers get increasingly sparse as their values increase with the smallest number being 561. 
* Successfully found up to 30 Carmichael numbers with the greatest number being calculated as 552,721 in less than a second.

[Pythagorean Triples](https://github.com/CarolPachar/Pythagorean-Triples.git) (October 2025)
* Created a Python program to investigate any underlying patterns or properties in Pythagorean Triples (a,b,c) which satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  
* By using matplotlib and numpy, a graphical and algebraic approach was used in order to prove what was hypothesized: that every Pythagorean Triple is a positive integer multiple of a primitive Pythagorean triple, and that these primitive Pythagorean triples correspond to the unique lines observed in the graphical representation of the Pythagorean doubles (a,b). 

[The Normalization Advantage](https://github.com/CarolPachar/The-Normalization-Advantage.git) (September 2025 - December 2025)
* Created a Python program to investigate the difference (in terms of clustering quality and runtime) between using a normalized Laplacian matrix versus an unnormalized Laplacian matrix for spectral clustering on two datasets: Zachary’s Karate Club and the Stochastic Block Model.
* Developed a spectral clustering function as well as implemented the normalized and the unnormalized Laplacian matrices.
